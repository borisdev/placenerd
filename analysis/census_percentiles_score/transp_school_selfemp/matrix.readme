VARIABLES FOR EACH COLUMNS OF THE MATRIX IN ORDER:

"bikers","walkers","masters_degree","self_employed","mixrace","mobility_abroad","mobility_msa"

Issues:

1. replace values where a shapefile geoid does not also exist in the data with
nan before re-ordering, or else they erroneously become zeros

2. my percentiles function might not be handling numpy.nan and zeros correctly

3. Why inf?

In [116]: mean(D["bikers"])
Out[116]: inf

In [127]: sum(np.isinf(D["bikers"]))
Out[127]: 0
